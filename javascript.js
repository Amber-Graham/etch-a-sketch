// Things we will need that the assignment is already telling us:
// create a webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs
// divs will be created using JS 
// put the square divs inside a large "container" div
// the container div will go directly into the HTML
// keep in mind: margins and borders may affect the square divs
// set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when 
    // your mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through
    // your grid like a pen would
// "Hovering" is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends 
    // when your mouse leaves it. set up event listeners for these 
// add a class to the div to change the color (maybe use classList.add?)
// add a button to the top of the screen
    // users will be prompted to enter in a number that represents
    // the number of squares per side for the new grid
// once the number is entered, the existing grid should be removed 
    // and a new one should be generated in the same total space as before
    // so you have a new sketch pad. make sure to set the limit for the user 
    // input to a mex of 100 
// research button tags in html and how you can make a JS function 
    //run when one is clicked
// if a user enters 64, they should have a brand new 64x64 grid
    // pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used

// basically: there will be an interface that lives at the top of the page
    // this interface will have the etch-a-sketch title
    // it will have a section for the user to adjust the grid
    // it will have the color mode option (bonus points only)
    // it will have a reset option
    // when the mouse goes over the grid, it will color the square to black
        // or a random RGB color
