# etch-a-sketch

This is the Etch-a-Sketch project for 
The Odin Project. The goal is take what
I have learned thus far as well as look
on google to discover the best way to
conduct this project.

I will update the ReadMe with my final
thoughts once i'm done. :) 

final thoughts: this was hard!
I had to look up tutorials, but what made
me incredibly happy, was that my pseudocode
was what i wanted. i just needed help 
visualizing the actual functions. 

creating the HTML and CSS was also very easy.
I remember when I was struggling to write HTML
or CSS in any meaningful way. I'm SO happy that 
it came so easy this time. I'm hoping I will 
feel this way about JS soon too. 

CSS grid was a completely new tool for me to use.
There is A LOT I still don't know about CSS grid, 
but I know it's an extremely useful tool.

I'm thinking I may come back to this and create the
same etch-a-sketch, but will the other tools mentioned
in the assignment.
