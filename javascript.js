// Things we will need that the assignment is already telling us:
// create a webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs
// divs will be created using JS 
// put the square divs inside a large "container" div
// keep in mind: margins and borders may affect the square divs
// set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when 
    // your mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through
    // your grid like a pen would
// "Hovering" is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends 
    // when your mouse leaves it. set up event listeners for these 
// add a class to the div to change the color (maybe use classList.add?)
// add a slider to the top of the screen to go all the way up to 50 x 50 grid
// if the slider is adjusted, the grid resets
// there will also be a reset button
// research button tags in html and how you can make a JS function 
    //run when one is clicked

// things i KNOW i need

const container = document.querySelector('#container');

// i will need a const for the square divs
// a formula to change the grid size according to the slider
// a function to call the grid size
// a function to create the grid
// a function for the square to listen when the mouse hovers over it
// a function to allow the slider to go all the way up to 50
// a function for if the mouse hovers over the square, then the color changes
// a function for when the reset button is clicked
